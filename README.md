# Rsqlite
Remaking a SQLite is fun. So I do it.

Some goals in the roadmap is heavily inspired by the [CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/sqlite)' SQLite course.

The goal here is not to simply go through every quiz provided by others but to actually implement a sqlite that's usable on my own. So I started this project.

In the current stage, I will only implement some basic functionalities. The second and following stage is for more *advanced* stuff. So notice, code in this project is subject to radical changes.
## Stage1 Roadmap
- [ ] Implement the `Rsqlite3 sample.db .Dbinfo` command.
- [ ] Implement the `Rsqlite3 sample.db .tables` command.
- [ ] Support `SELECT`.
  - [ ] Support `SELECT` one column.
  - [ ] Support `SELECT` multiple columns.
- [ ] Support `WHERE` clause.
- [ ] Support retrieving data using an index.
